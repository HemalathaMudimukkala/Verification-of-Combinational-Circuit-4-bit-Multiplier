# Verification-of-Combinational-Circuit-4-bit-Multiplier
This project focuses on the verification of a 4-bit multiplier combinational circuit using SystemVerilog and the UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) framework. The multiplier design is straightforward, taking two 4-bit inputs and producing an 8-bit output as the product. The verification environment is developed in UVM, consisting of a generator, driver, monitor, and scoreboard. The generator creates randomized test inputs, while the driver applies these inputs to the DUT (Design Under Test). The monitor captures the output, and the scoreboard compares the DUT's output against the expected result to validate the design's functionality. The testbench is encapsulated within a UVM test, which controls the execution and ensures comprehensive verification coverage. This project demonstrates proficiency in both digital design and verification methodologies, ensuring the correct operation of the multiplier across a variety of input conditions.
